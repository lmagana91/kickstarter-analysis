# kickstarter-analysis
Performing an analysis on the Kickstarter data to determine trends
### Challenge
##### Outcomes Based on Goals Analysis:
When we analyze the subcategory "plays" we notice that based on the goal amount the outcome has a reflective graph starting at success being most likely for goals under $1000, the level of success diminishes from this point the outcomes are equal at goals of $20000 to $24999. Success is higher than failure for goals of $40000 to $49999 at this goal range there is a percentage of success greater than 60%. We also notice that anything greater than $50000 is likely to fail in reaching the goal. I believe for us to better analyze the data we would need to look at the percentage funded given our current data just looks at whether the goal was met or not but not by how much for example there was a play with an $18000 goal and had almost 70% funded yet it failed given it wasn't funded over 100% yet there was a play that had a goal of $1 and given it raised $65 it was successfully funded.

##### Outcomes Based on Launch Date Analysis:
When we analyze a campaign's launch date we can determine that the largest difference between the amount of successful goals and failed goals is in the month of May; where 111 are successful and 52 failed. Based on this data we can determine that launch date in the month of May is most successful. A large limitation is we are grouping all months together and do not focus on if there is a trend by analyzing the years for example are certain years more successful and reviewing other factors for example disposable income. We can also see if there is an increase when we analyze recent years vs older years.

##### Recommendation Based on Analysis:
Based on our analysis we can determine that campaign's with goals of less than $1000 are much more successful and able to meet the goal in a quicker time frame than those with goals higher than $50000.
