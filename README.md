##### Outcomes Based on Goals Analysis:
When we analyze the subcategory "plays" we notice that based on the goal amount the outcome has a reflective graph starting at success being most likely for goals under $1000, the level of success diminishes from this point the outcomes are equal at goals of $20000 to $24999. Success is higher than failure for goals of $40000 to $49999 at this goal range there is a percentage of success greater than 60%. We also notice that anything greater than $50000 is likely to fail in reaching the goal. I believe for us to better analyze the data we would need to look at the percentage funded given our current data just looks at whether the goal was met or not but not by how much for example there was a play with an $18000 goal and had almost 70% funded yet it failed given it wasn't funded over 100% yet there was a play that had a goal of $1 and given it raised $65 it was successfully funded.
